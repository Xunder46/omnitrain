# OmniTrain Design System

## Core Design Philosophy: Minimum Friction

Every design decision serves one question: **does this help the athlete get to work faster?**

- If a UI element requires waiting, it should be eliminated or deferred
- If an interaction requires multiple taps, it should be reduced to one
- If information is decorative rather than functional, it must still earn its place by enhancing focus or reducing cognitive load
- The app is a tool, not a destination — beautiful, but never in the way

### The Splash Screen Litmus Test

A splash screen was added and then commented out. The reasoning: "I don't want to look at the splash logo, I am here to workout." This is the benchmark for every design decision. If it doesn't serve the workout, it doesn't belong in the critical path.

## Visual Identity: Spacecraft Interior

The aesthetic is **spacecraft interior** — not cosmic/outer-space, but the controlled, purposeful environment *inside* the ship. Think: precision instrumentation, ambient lighting, surfaces that communicate status without demanding attention.

### Mood Keywords
- Zen — calm, focused, undistracted
- Tranquil — nothing screams for attention
- Aura / Halo — subtle light emanation, not explosion
- Precision — engineered, intentional, not decorative
- Premium — feels crafted, not templated

### What We Are NOT
- Cosmic/galaxy wallpaper aesthetic
- Generic 3-color Material theme
- Apple Fitness sterile minimalism
- Neon-overload gaming UI
- Average fitness app with stock photography

## Color System

### Theme: Abyssal Neon Dark

| Token | Hex | Role |
|-------|-----|------|
| Background Top | `#0F1F33` | Deep navy gradient start |
| Background Bottom | `#060B14` | Near-black gradient end |
| Surface | `#0E223A` | Card/panel background |
| Surface Border | `#FFFFFF` @ 6% | Subtle boundary definition |
| Primary (Neon Cyan) | `#2DE2E6` | Interactive elements, accents |
| Secondary (Muted Teal) | `#1B9AAA` | Supporting accents |
| Zen Core Glow | `#00CFFF` | Logo/brand element glow |
| Text Primary | `#FFFFFF` @ 90% | Main content text |
| Text Secondary | `#FFFFFF` @ 70% | Supporting text, labels |
| Material Background | `#0B0F14` | Material theme scaffold |
| Material Surface | `#121826` | Material component surfaces |
| Text Muted | `#9BA4B5` | Tertiary text |
| Divider | `#1F2937` | Separators |

### Color Usage Rules
1. **Background** is always the cosmic gradient — never flat
2. **Surfaces** float above the background with depth (shadow + border)
3. **Cyan/teal accents** indicate interactivity or active state — never decorative filler
4. **White text** with opacity levels creates hierarchy without introducing new hues
5. **Gradient colors** on tiles are functional — they differentiate workout categories
6. **Glow effects** are reserved for active/selected states and brand elements

## Typography

| Level | Style | Spacing |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Headers | Letter-spacing 3.0 | Wide, commanding — section titles, brand text |
| Titles | Letter-spacing 0.4 | Slightly tracked — card labels, navigation |
| Labels | Letter-spacing 2.0 | Uppercase or small-caps feel — chip labels, metadata |
| Body | Default | Clean and readable — descriptions, notes |

### Typography Rules
1. Favor **system fonts** — speed over custom font loading
2. **Wide letter-spacing** for headers communicates premium without a custom typeface
3. Body text must be immediately readable at arm's length (gym context)
4. Never use more than 3 type weights on a single screen

## Spacing & Layout

| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Surface Border Radius | 20.0 | Standard card rounding — generous, modern |
| Border Width | 1.0 | Subtle surface definition |
| Energy Core Size | 78.0 | Standard icon circle on tiles |
| Zen Halo Size | 160.0 | Logo/brand mark container |
| Halo Stroke Width | 7.0 | Enso arc thickness |

### Layout Rules
1. **Mobile-first, watch-aware** — design for the smallest screen, then scale up
2. Tiles use `LayoutBuilder` to adapt — labels hide below 100px width
3. Generous padding and touch targets — minimum 48dp tap areas (gym gloves, sweaty fingers)
4. Vertical scrolling preferred — horizontal swipe only for carousel/peek patterns
5. Information density scales with screen size, never with complexity

## Depth & Shadow System

| Shadow | Properties | Usage |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Deep Shadow | Black 55%, blur 30, offset (0, 14) | All elevated surfaces — strong vertical lift |
| Glow Shadow | Color-based, blur 24, spread 0, 35% opacity | Active states, energy cores, brand elements |
| Active Border | White @ 15%, 2px width | Selected/active tile indicator |

### Depth Rules
1. Every card/surface has `deepShadow` — no flat surfaces floating in space
2. Glow is additive — only appears on interaction or active selection
3. Shadow direction is always **downward** — consistent overhead light source
4. Never use drop shadows on text

## Interaction & Animation

| Token | Value | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Press Scale | 0.96 | Tactile press feedback |
| Animation Duration | 180ms | Standard transition |
| Animation Curve | easeInOut | Smooth, natural motion |
| Splash Duration | 2800ms | Brand animation (deferred) |
| Stroke Draw | 1200ms | Enso arc reveal |
| Breathing Pulse | 3000ms | Ambient logo animation |
| Rotation | 8000ms | Slow perpetual logo rotation |

### Animation Rules
1. **Interactions are instant-feeling** — 180ms is the maximum for press/release feedback
2. **No animations in the critical path** — never make the user wait for an animation to complete before they can act
3. **Ambient animations** (breathing, rotation) are for idle/brand moments only
4. **Press-scale** is the universal interaction feedback — every tappable element uses it
5. Transitions between screens should be fast, not cinematic
6. No bouncing, no elastic overshoots — smooth and controlled, like spacecraft instrument panels

## Component Patterns

### Naming Conventions
| Prefix | Domain | Examples |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `Omni` | Foundational layout primitives | `OmniSurface`, `OmniGradientBackground` |
| `Energy` | Interactive card-level components | `EnergyTile`, `EnergyCore` |
| `Zen` | Brand/logo elements | `ZenHaloPainter`, `AnimatedZenHalo` |

### Surface Composition
```
OmniGradientBackground          ← Full-screen cosmic backdrop
  └── OmniSurface               ← Dark navy card with border + deep shadow
       └── Content               ← Text, icons, interactive elements
```

### Interactive Tile Pattern
```
GestureDetector (press tracking)
  └── AnimatedScale (press feedback)
       └── Container (gradient surface + shadows)
            └── EnergyCore (icon) + Label
```

### Key Patterns
1. **Composable, not inherited** — primitives are combined, not subclassed
2. **State is local for UI, external for data** — `_isPressed` is local widget state; workout data comes from ChangeNotifier
3. **Deprecated widgets redirect** — old widgets are stubs pointing to canonical implementations
4. **Constants centralized** — all design tokens live in `OmniTheme`

## Accessibility Requirements

1. **Contrast** — text must meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 for body, 3:1 for large text) against surface colors
2. **Touch targets** — minimum 48x48 dp for all interactive elements
3. **Color is never the only differentiator** — icons and labels accompany color-coded tiles
4. **Screen reader support** — all interactive elements must have semantic labels
5. **Reduced motion** — respect `MediaQuery.disableAnimations`; skip ambient animations
6. **Readability at distance** — text sizes must be legible at arm's length in gym lighting

---

## Known Inconsistencies (To Resolve)

1. **Dual color definitions** — `OmniTheme` surface/text colors diverge slightly from Material `buildTheme()` values. Custom widgets use `OmniTheme` directly; Material components use the theme. These should be unified.
2. **Buttons directory empty** — no standardized button components yet; button patterns should be derived from the tile interaction model.
3. **Hardcoded icon sizes** — 70px tile icon, 40% core percentage. Should become `OmniTheme` tokens.
